//! A journal of foreground work and the semantic boundaries between activity intervals.
//!
//! The foreground thread records task polls, action handlers, input dispatches,
//! draws, and presentations as [`ForegroundEvent`]s in a bounded journal ring.
//! Task polls shorter than [`TASK_POLL_FLOOR`] are folded into summaries, which
//! bound the stream by the number of slow polls while preserving their exact
//! count and total duration.
//!
//! Presentation, completed frame skips, and foreground idle are explicit
//! [`IntervalBoundary`] entries in the same stream. Independent [`ForegroundJournalCollector`]s
//! feed entries to [`IntervalSealer`], a pure state machine that groups all work
//! preceding each boundary into a [`FrameSnapshot`]. The sealer does not infer
//! boundaries from elapsed time or from incidental event kinds such as draws.
