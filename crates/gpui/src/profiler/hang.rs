//! Post-hoc detection of foreground hangs from the journal's event stream.
//!
//! A hang is any single piece of foreground work — a task poll, an action
//! handler, an input dispatch, a window draw, or platform presentation — that
//! blocked the foreground thread for at least a threshold duration. An
//! interval whose total foreground spend reached the frame budget also
//! counts, even when no single event crossed the threshold: many small
//! pieces of work can drop a frame — or starve a headless app — as
//! thoroughly as one long stall. [`HangDetector`] drains the journal and
//! reports each completed activity interval containing hangs as a
//! [`HangIncident`].
