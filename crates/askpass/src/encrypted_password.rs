//! This module provides [EncryptedPassword] for storage of passwords in memory.
//! On Windows that's implemented with CryptProtectMemory/CryptUnprotectMemory; on other platforms it just falls through
//! to string for now.
//!
//! The "safety" of this module lies in exploiting visibility rules of Rust:
//! 1. No outside module has access to the internal representation of [EncryptedPassword].
//! 2. [EncryptedPassword] cannot be converted into a [String] or any other plaintext representation.
//! All use cases that do need such functionality (of which we have two right now) are implemented within this module.
//!
//! Note that this is not bulletproof.
//! 1. [ProcessExt] is implemented for [smol::process::Command], which is a builder for smol processes.
//! Before the process itself is spawned the contents of [EncryptedPassword] are unencrypted in env var storage of said builder.
//! 2. We're also sending plaintext passwords over RPC with [proto::AskPassResponse]. Go figure how great that is.
//!
//! Still, the goal of this module is to not have passwords laying around nilly-willy in memory.
//! We do not claim that it is fool-proof.
